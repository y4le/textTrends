// @texttrends/core — the analysis engine.
//
// This package is environment-agnostic by contract: no DOM, no Worker, no
// filesystem, no framework imports. Buffers and plain data in, typed results
// out. The web app wraps it in a Web Worker; the CLI wraps it in Node.
//
// The public surface is defined by the analysis contract
// (docs/design/analysis-contract.md) and grows here as each part is
// implemented; methods are specified in docs/design/statistics.md.

// Explicit .ts specifiers keep these modules loadable under Node's type-stripping
// runner as well as bundlers — the CLI adapter depends on it.
